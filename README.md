# Zock

Very minimalistic Python script to calculate results of a special golf tournament.

The rules:
- 9 holes 
- matchplay each player against every other (net)
- handicaps > difference > *3/4 > even: 50% odd: 50%+half stroke
- based on course GC Mannheim-Viernheim holes 1-9
- also net points stableford based on 18 hole calculation

Runs in Pythonista on iPhone.
